FAQ

  *What is this project about?*

The mission of this project is to provide Home Assistant custom component developers
a ready-to-use template with best practices from `Home Assistant developers documentation`_
and from `Hypermodern Python`_ blog articles.

   *Where does the custom component come from?*

The code of the custom component generated by this cookiecuter has been intitated and maintained
by `@Ludeeus`_. I try to keep synchronized with it and implement additional features.
